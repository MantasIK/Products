"Products" is a system design project that I worked on which (combined with other back-end projects) replaces the database for
an e-commerse website with webscale in mind. This includes an ETL process, cleaning and formatting the data, building out a 
new architecture, making design decisions, and similar challenges.

"Products" quite literally focuses on all the data related to the products found on the website such as
name, id, sizes, styles, descriptions, related items, pictures, etc.

During my time working on this project I became interested in Node.js clustering capabilities and their practical applications
to handle server requests simultaneously (something Node has toruble with, since it is written in JS).
I decided to run some tests on the finished system and had a field day.


Below is a gist journal that I kept in order to record my "experiments" for any curious minds out there.
